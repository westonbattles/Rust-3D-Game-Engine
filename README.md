# Rust 3D Game Engine

## Overview
This project is a 3D game engine written in Rust. It was done as a passion project and as a way for me to blend my love for Rust and game development.
Going through with this project really opened my eyes to how easily I take for granted the much-streamlined rendering pipeline, and I have a crazy greater appreciation for it now.

## Helpful Resources
These helped guide me through the process a lot:
- [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)
- [how 2 code game 3d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFZKSV2zieM)
- [Rust Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKLYgl4Nuc&list=PL6TfJEvHZ7C--kM59vKUwNnh30ngWZKUD)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
If you want to download and run the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust if installed via `rustup`)

Next, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Rust-3D-Game-Engine.git
cd Rust-3D-Game-Engine
```

and then simply run:

```bash
cargo run --bin engine_tester
```

hope u enjoy my lil road -v-
